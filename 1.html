    <p>Today <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/" target="_blank" title="W3C">W3C</a> released to the public the April 2021 edition of our
    W3C Strategic Highlights which documents the tremendous work to enhance,
    grow and strengthen the Web platform, and how the
    Web Consortium meets the needs of industry and society as a whole.</p>

    <p>At the same time, as we celebrate the anniversary of the release of
    the World Wide Web into the public domain on 30 April 1993 by CERN, our
    CEO Jeff Jaffe has published his reflections on the centrality of the
    Web Consortium as the Web has been accelerating to meet society’s needs,
    and on the importance of the Web infrastructure in the modern world.</p>
